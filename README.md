# Raspberry-Kinect-Opencv
Spheres Recognition Color-Depth

Hi there! This is my first project,

The first version will be uploaded in November of 2016
Will be a program developed with python, Kinect and Raspberry Pi 1 B+ 
to recognize spheres and their position on coordinates x, y, in cm respect the position of the Kinect Sensor.

Recognize only two colors (orange and green).
The model of the xBox360 kinect sensor vs.1414

Thanks,
