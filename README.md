# Raspberry-Kinect-Opencv
Spheres Recognition Color-Depth

Hi there! This is my first project,
First version

This is an artifitial vision system for robotics application, developed with Python and OpenCV, acquiring the images with a Kinect sensor and processing them with a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

The system recognizes spheres and their position on coordinates x, y, in cm respect the position of the Kinect Sensor.

Recognizes only two colors (orange and green).
The Kinect sensor used is the xBox360 Kinect Sensor - 1414

Thanks,
