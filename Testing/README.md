This are Testings of the artificial vision system.

Here, the code within the file "DetectorVN_LabPruebaEscritorio.py" displays on the screen what is watching and what is processing.
It shows the color filtered images, where the white areas are the zones of the image that have the color range specified. Creating the green mask and the orange mask.

You can see the tracking of the green and orange balls if and the total distance from the kinect sensor like is shown in image "example.PNG"

In the other file "onlyWebCam.py" you can test only the color and sphere recognition without the distance and using a 
webcam instead the Kinect Sensor
